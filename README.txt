Code Description
We connect our buzzer(4), keypad and servo motor(3) to digital pins. We define keys for the keypad so that we can generate the entered values. 
Each time we press the button, the bell sounds a tone every 50 milliseconds, and an asterisk (*) is displayed on the LCD for the number of presses on the screen. 
The password we entered is compared with the original password (1234) by pressing the asterisk (*) key, if the entered password is the same as the real password, our servo motor opens the door that rotates 90 degrees every 15 segments every second, after 2 seconds the servo motor returns to its previous position and the door closes. 
If the password is entered incorrectly, the door will not be opened and the password will be requested again.
